# Transpilers, compilers and interpreters that target shell scripts as a runtime

## Experimental

### bashscript

https://github.com/niieani/bashscript

> BashScript
> A JavaScript/TypeScript to bash transpiler. Work in progress.
> Why? Mainly because I wanted to learn how to make a transpiler.
> I also wanted to experiment with bash and how far we could stretch this old, yet widely cross-platform language.
> I've previously created a framework trying to make bash as usable as possible: Bash Infinity. This seemed like the natural next step.
> Not much works, but it's cool. :-)

> LLVM IR to Bash 4.x Transpiler
> Why? Because

> Yeah, we donâ€™t have hello working yet. The plan if we ever continue development is to get function parameters working and then start work on a standard library and linker.

## Released

### BashClass

https://github.com/amirbawab/BashClass

> BashClass is a programming language supporting Object Oriented Programming, and compiles to BASH 4.4. Class members written in BashClass are converted to an associative array with unique indices in the generated BASH script.
> BashClass syntax is close to other programming languages like C++ and Java, however, instead of compiling to machine code or bytecode, BashClass compiles to Bash.
> BashClass performs type checking at compile time. An expression can be forced to be of a specific type by casting it. The type of an object can also be checked at runtime

### Batsh

https://github.com/batsh-dev-team/Batsh

> A language that compiles to Bash and Windows Batch
> It enables you to write your script once runs on all platforms without any additional dependency.
> The syntax of Batsh is C-based (derived from C programming language). If you have learned C, Java, C++ or JavaScript, Batsh is quite easy for you.
