## modernish

https://github.com/modernish/modernish

> Modernish is a library for shell script programming which provides features like safer variable and command expansion, new language constructs for loop iteration, and much more. Modernish programs are shell programs; the new constructs are mixed with shell syntax so that the programmer can take advantage of the best of both.

## shtk

https://github.com/jmmv/shtk

> The Shell Toolkit, or shtk for short, is an application toolkit for programmers writing POSIX-compliant shell scripts. shtk provides a collection of reusable modules that work on a wide variety of operating systems and shell interpreters. These modules are all ready to be used by calling the provided shtk_import primitive and "compiling" the shell scripts into their final form using the shtk(1) utility. shtk is known to be compatible with at least bash, dash, pdksh and zsh, and continuous integration tests prove this to be the case.
